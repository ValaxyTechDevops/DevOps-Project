2. Command line, with or without GitHub CLI 


# Working with repositories
Any number of people can work together in repositories across GitHub. You can configure settings, create project boards, and manage your notifications to encourage effective collaboration.

#### Creating a repository
A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have any number of public and private repositories in your user account. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, as well as the revision history for all files in the repository. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories
When you create a new repository, you should initialize the repository with a README file to let people know about your project. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-new-repository

#### Cloning a repository
You can clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local computer, making it easier to add or remove files, fix merge conflicts, or make complex commits. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository

#### Forking a repository
A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage, where any changes you make will not affect the original repository unless you submit a pull request to the project owner. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github

#### Importing your projects
If you have existing projects you'd like to move over to GitHub you can import projects using the GitHub Importer, the command line, or external migration tools. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github

#### Managing collaborators and permissions
You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and project boards. You can invite other people to your repository as collaborators from the Collaborators tab in the repository settings. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

You are the owner of any repository you create in your user account and have full control of the repository. Collaborators have write access to your repository, limiting what they have permission to do. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository

#### Managing repository settings
As the owner of a repository you can configure several settings, including the repository's visibility, topics, and social media preview. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings

#### Setting up your project for healthy contributions
To encourage collaborators in your repository, you need a community that encourages people to use, contribute to, and evangelize your project. For more information, see https://opensource.guide/building-community/ in the Open Source Guides.

By adding files like contributing guidelines, a code of conduct, and a license to your repository you can create an environment where it's easier for collaborators to make meaningful, useful contributions. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions

#### Using GitHub Issues and project boards
You can use GitHub Issues to organize your work with issues and pull requests and manage your workflow with project boards. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues and https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards

#### Managing notifications
Notifications provide updates about the activity on GitHub you've subscribed to or participated in. If you're no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe, unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you'll receive in the future. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/about-notifications

#### Working with GitHub Pages
You can use GitHub Pages to create and host a website directly from a repository on GitHub.com. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages

#### Using GitHub Discussions
You can enable GitHub Discussions for your repository to help build a community around your project. Maintainers, contributors and visitors can use discussions to share announcements, ask and answer questions, and participate in conversations around goals. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions
